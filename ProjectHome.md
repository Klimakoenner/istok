Istok is a new sans serif typeface. At present it has the four fonts with support for Latin and Cyrillic. The font includes oldstyle figure variants and small capitals (Regular only). Most glyphs are manually instructed using xgridfit, but other ones are autoinstructed in fontforge. Truetype instructions are specifically intended for rendering on LCD displays.

The Russian word исток [istók] means source.

The fonts are distributed under the terms of either [GNU General Public License Version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) with the font exception or [Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL). The font sources have only GNU General Public License Version 3.
